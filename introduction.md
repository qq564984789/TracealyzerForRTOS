##Intro
        Percepio Tracealyzer reveals what is actually going on in embedded and IoT systems during runtime. Trace the real-time behavior of your operating system and application, gain insight with sophisticated visualization. Avoid the *guesswork* and *boost* your productivity. Find *bottlenecks* and improve performance. Available for several operating systems, including FreeRTOS, Micrium µC/OS, Linux and Wind River VxWorks.

##Comments
“Tracealyzer has doubled our development speed. Problems that otherwise would take days to solve are obvious with this tool and just a quick fix. We use it all the time.”
Alex Pabouctisids, Lead Firmware Engineer        Flyability

“Tracealyzer allowed me to quickly understand and solve serious multi-threading issues, that otherwise would have taken least two weeks to analyze. I got started and solved the first issue in a single day. I strongly recommend Percepio’s tracing tools.”
Chaabane Malki, Embedded Systems Engineer         CGX AERO

“The many system views of the Tracealyzer from Percepio makes it easy to quickly find solutions that we have not seen using (Wind River) System Viewer. The visualization has several advantages over the system viewer and makes it easier to understand system behavior. This tool would be of great use for us.”
Johan Fredriksson, Software Architect               SAAB AB

“Our goal is to integrate internet, mobile internet, digital broadcast networks and home network, in a way that creates an interesting user experience. This puts enormous quality requirements on the software we develop and Tracealyzer gives a very good support in this.”

“ABB Robotics is using the first generation Tracealyzer in all of the IRC5 robot controllers shipped since 2005. The tool has proven its value many times in all corners of the world.”
Roger Kulläng, Global System Architect       ABB Robotics

"Tracealyzer have enabled us to better understand and further improve our embedded software. Using this tool we have been able to identify performance bottlenecks and solve problems, which otherwise would have been very hard to analyze.”

“In less than 5 days from running the tool, we improved the performance of our graphic rendering engine by 3x!”
